# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** February 18, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how the IINTS-AF SDK (“IINTS-AF”, “we”, “us”) handles information when you use the software.

---

## 1) Scope
This policy applies to the **IINTS-AF SDK** repository, CLI tools, and bundled example assets. It does **not** cover third‑party services you may choose to connect (e.g., Nightscout, Tidepool, or dataset hosts).

---

## 2) Information We Collect
**By default, the SDK does not collect or transmit personal data.**

The SDK operates locally on your machine. We do **not** run a server, and we do **not** collect telemetry or analytics by default.

You may choose to:
- Import **your own data** (CSV/JSON/CGM data)
- Connect to **third‑party services** (e.g., Nightscout, Tidepool) via optional connectors
- Download **public datasets** from external providers

All such data is processed **locally** unless you explicitly send it elsewhere.

---

## 3) How We Use Information
When you use the SDK, data is used only to:
- Run simulations and analyses
- Generate reports and audit trails
- Export metrics, CSVs, or PDFs

The SDK does not upload data unless you explicitly configure a third‑party connection or run a network transfer yourself.

---

## 4) Sharing and Disclosure
We do **not** share data with third parties because we do not collect it.

If you connect to third‑party services, those services have their own privacy policies and data handling practices.

---

## 5) Data Retention
All data remains on your system unless you choose to export, upload, or share it. You control retention and deletion.

---

## 6) Security
The SDK does not provide centralized hosting. You are responsible for securing any data stored or processed locally.

---

## 7) Children’s Privacy
The SDK is intended for research and engineering users. It is not designed for use by children.

---

## 8) International Use
IINTS-AF is distributed globally. If you use the SDK, you are responsible for compliance with local data laws and research regulations.

---

## 9) Changes to this Policy
We may update this policy as the SDK evolves. Changes will be reflected in the repository.
