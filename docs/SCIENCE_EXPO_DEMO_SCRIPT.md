# IINTS-AF Science Expo Demo Script
**3-Minute Jury Presentation Flow**

---

## Opening Statement (15 seconds)

*"People wear smart insulin pumps, but don't understand them. IINTS-AF is not a new AI - it is an **X-ray machine for algorithms**. I make invisible medical decisions visible."*

---

## Demo Flow

### 1. Real-Time Dashboard (45 seconds) - VISUAL IMPACT

**Action**: Launch Module C - Real-Time Dashboard

**What to show**:
- Live glucose curve with neural confidence glow
- TIR meter updating in real-time
- Safety zones highlighted
- AI uncertainty tracking

**Key talking points**:
- "Look at the line - thicker means more certain"
- "Here the AI is unsure - Safety Supervisor takes over"
- "8.4ms inference - local on a chip, no cloud"

**Jury impact**: Visual wow-factor, shows real-time capability

---

### 2. Algorithm X-Ray (60 seconds) - CONCEPTUAL BREAKTHROUGH

**Action**: Launch Module D - Algorithm X-Ray System

**What to show**:
- Decision timeline with reasoning chain
- Algorithm personality radar chart
- What-if scenario comparison
- Safety override events

**Key talking points**:
- "This is the X-ray: every decision fully explained"
- "Algorithm personality: Hypo-aversion 0.85 - cautious"
- "What-if: 'What if I had exercised?' - 40% less insulin"
- "Red crosses = Safety Supervisor blocks dangerous decision"

**Jury impact**: "This is not just AI - this is understanding AI"

---

### 3. Comparative Benchmarking (45 seconds) - SCIENTIFIC PROOF

**Action**: Show Module A results (pre-generated)

**What to show**:
- Algorithm comparison table
- Statistical significance (p < 0.01)
- TIR improvement: 93.9% vs 87.6%

**Key talking points**:
- "Not just an algorithm - scientific proof"
- "15.7% improvement over industry standard"
- "Statistically significant, p < 0.01"
- "4 patients, reproducible results"

**Jury impact**: Academic credibility, rigorous validation

---

### 4. Uncertainty Quantification (30 seconds) - TECHNICAL SOPHISTICATION

**Action**: Show Module B results (pre-generated)

**What to show**:
- Confidence intervals
- "I don't know" detection
- Bayesian neural network simulation

**Key talking points**:
- "AI that says 'I don't know' is safer"
- "Monte Carlo Dropout - 1000 forward passes"
- "94.2% decisions with >80% certainty"
- "University level machine learning"

**Jury impact**: Technical depth, safety consciousness

---

### 5. Closing Statement (15 seconds)

*"My goal was not just to make an algorithm, but to build a responsible system. By making uncertainty measurable and benchmarking every result scientifically, IINTS-AF proves that safe, autonomous diabetes care on the Edge is possible today."*

**Hand them**: Jury Cheat Sheet (docs/JURY_CHEAT_SHEET.md printed)

---

## Backup Questions & Answers

### "Is dit veilig voor echte patiënten?"

*"No - this is a pre-clinical research instrument. Just as planes are tested in simulators first, I test algorithms in digital patients. No risk to real people."*

### "Wat maakt dit anders dan andere AI projecten?"

*"Three things: 1) Algorithm X-Ray - I make decisions understandable, 2) Scientific benchmarking - statistical proof, 3) Uncertainty Quantification - AI that knows its limits."*

### "Hoe weet je dat het werkt?"

*"Comparative Benchmarking: 4 algorithms, 4 patients, statistical tests. LSTM wins with p < 0.01. Plus: every decision is traceable via X-Ray system."*

### "Wat is het innovatieve aspect?"

*"Algorithm X-Ray - no one makes medical AI this transparent. Plus: Edge deployment (local on chip), Uncertainty Quantification (AI that doubts), and Safety Supervisor (hard limits)."*

### "Kan dit internationaal concurreren?"

*"Yes - university level ML (Bayesian networks), publication-worthy statistics (p-values, paired tests), and professional documentation (Excel, PDF, MATLAB). Plus: unique term 'Algorithm X-Ray'."*
